# Sprint 2 Report 
Video Link: https://youtu.be/lvB4yp-mKB0
## What's New (User Facing)
 * Enroll In Course #5
 * Edit Course #11
 * Sync With Database #12

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, our team completed three key foundational features for our project. We completed the Enroll In Course feature, which allows students to enroll in courses. The Edit Course feature was completed, which allows admins to edit course details for a selected course. Lastly, we developed the Sync With Database feature, which reads and writes system information from our .csv database files.

## Unfinished Work
We were unable to verify the functionality of the Drop Course feature due to issues a team member had with pushing to the repository. Therefore it is not considered complete.
