# Sprint x Report 
Video Link: 
## What's New (User Facing)
 * User Login #1
 * Browse Courses #2
 * View Course Information #4

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, our team completed three key foundational features for our project. We completed the User Login feature, which allows users to access their accounts. The Browse Courses feature was completed, which allows students to view available courses. Lastly, we developed the View Course Information feature, which provides information for courses when selected by the user. We found that using C# with Avalonia was difficult because not all of us have experience with C# and Avalonia.

## Unfinished Work
The feature we planned to implement in this sprint but did not finish was the Enroll In Course feature. It will be added to the next sprint.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * All features that were implemented work and meet acceptance criteria
  * We all learned how to use C# and Avalonia
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Improving coding standards
   * Useful commenting
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Features to work on should be less related to minimize merge conflicts
   * More frequent commits and pushes
   * Set clear expectations for features
